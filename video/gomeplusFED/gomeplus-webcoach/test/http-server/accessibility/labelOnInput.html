  <h1>Curtis Mayfield - Right On For The Darkness</h1>
  <pre>I am blind and I cannot see
You are there, your petty evil don't bother me
Playing all the clothes you wear
Laugh at me, pressed and clean, and I don't care

Right on for the darkness
Right on for the darkness

You pity fools, you pity fools
You better have some sympathy, yeah
'Cause this educated people
Running the lives of high society

Making up the blues
Holding back schools
Lot of greed, lot of temptation
Proof of one thing, we're a hell of a nation

Right on for the darkness
Right on, right on

Right on, right on
Right on, right on
Right on, right on for the darkness
Right on for the darkness

I am blind and I can't see how to understand
What do we need for justice
Is there really enough room to demand?
Old man you know too well us
You gain all your children's trust

Right on for the darkness
Right on for the darkness
Right on for the darkness

Right on, right on
Right on, right on for the darkness
Right on

Well the message with the tears
Through the eyes is everyone will see
I can hear the people's fears
[Incomprehensible] everywhere to me

Right on for the darkness
Right on, right on
Right on, right on for the darkness

I am blind and I cannot see
You are there, your petty evil don't bother me
Playing all the clothes you wear
Laugh at me, pressed and clean, and I don't care

Right on for the darkness
Right on for the darkness
Right on for the darkness
